             * receive messages.
             *
             * The server address and port are specified in the constructor so
             * if you need to receive messages from several different addresses
             * and/or port, you'll have to create a server for each.
             *
             * The address is a string and it can represent an IPv4 or IPv6
             * address.
             *
             * Note that this function calls connect() to connect the socket
             * to the specified address. To accept data on different UDP addresses
             * and ports, multiple UDP servers must be created.
             *
             * \note
             * The socket is open in this process. If you fork() or exec() then the
             * socket will be closed by the operating system.
             *
             * \warning
             * We only make use of the first address found by getaddrinfo(). All
             * the other addresses are ignored.
             *
             * \exception udp_client_server_runtime_error
             * The udp_client_server_runtime_error exception is raised when the address
             * and port combination cannot be resolved or if the socket cannot be
             * opened.
             *
             * \param[in] address  The address we receive on.
